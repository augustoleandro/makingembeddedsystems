## Introduction

Brazil has several problems in the public health system due to different cultural and political factors. Very few public hospitals in the country have any hospital infection control system, whether manual (carried out by nurses or doctors) or performed by some hardware. A device that measures temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure conditions in environments (e.g. operating room, ICU, patient rooms) could detect environments conducive to the proliferation of microorganisms.
According to the WHO (World Health Organization), 234 million operations are carried out per year worldwide. Of this total, about one million patients die from hospital infections. In Brazil, the hospital infection rate reaches 14%.

The device must be easy to install, that is, it must not require electrical infrastructure or data infrastructure. The reason is the installation in hospitals already in operation (retrofit). The device uses batteries, does not rely on an external power supply, and communicates with the gateway via wireless data transmission. The device is capable of measuring temperature, humidity and the differential pressure between the indoor environment and the outdoor environment (positive pressure or negative pressure).
